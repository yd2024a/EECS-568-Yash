    "Below we provide an guide for installing the Python wrapper of GTSAM library.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Method 1 (preferred): Using `conda`:\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    conda create -n na568 python==3.9 numpy==1.26.4 conda-forge::gtsam==4.2.0 conda-forge::matplotlib==3.8.3 conda-forge::jupyterlab scipy\n",

    "    Run this to activate the environment:\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    conda activate na568\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  Method 2: Using `pip`. According to [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/gtsam/4.2/#files) only Linux and MacOS is supported.\n",
    "    ```sh\n",
    "    pip install gtsam==4.2.0\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Method 3: Build from source. Follow the instructions\n",

    "\n",
    "    -   After you successfully clone the repository and create the build\n",
    "        folder, you'll have to first go into the cython folder and\n",
    "        install the required dependencies.\n",
    "        `pip install -r <gtsam_folder>/python/requirements.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Then you'll have to do cmake differently by specifying the the\n",

    "        `cmake .. -DGTSAM_BUILD_PYTHON=1 -DGTSAM_PYTHON_VERSION=<your_python_version>`\n",
    "\n",
    "    -   Compile the files in build (-j means using multi-thread. 10 is\n",
    "        the number of threads you want to use)\n",
    "        `make -j10`\n",

    "## Read the Following FAQ before Getting Started!\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Q: Which version of GTSAM should I use?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A: This homework is built with GTSAM 4.2.0 and the autograder will\n",
    "    use the same version to test your code. We noticed that GTSAM has\n",
    "    changed its Python interface multiple times before. It is recommended\n",
    "    to use this version in order to avoid error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Q: The logic of my code is correct but I can't get the expected result.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A: We noticed some students use the code shown below\n",
    "    experienced imperfect plot caused by precision issue.\n",
    "    `gtsam.Pose2([x,y,theta])`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Instead, the correct construction of the `Pose2` is\n",
    "    `gtsam.Pose2(x,y,theta)`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    You should follow the same pattern when constructing `Pose3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Q: How can I resolve the issues when installing the libraries?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A: Google your error information first, and try to find the answer\n",
    "    on the GitHub issues page and piazza. If it still exists, please\n",
    "    send a new piazza post with your system information, the version of\n",
    "    your coding language, and your error information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Q: I'm a Python user, but GTSAM only has C++ Doxygen documentation.\n",
    "    How do I know how to implement the algorithms?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A: Great question! Looking at [GTSAM python\n",
    "    examples](https://github.com/gtbook/gtsam-examples) from Github\n",
    "    would be sufficient for the Homework! Also, if you wish to look into\n",
    "    detailed function explanation and usage, unfortunately, you have to\n",
    "    refer to [C++\n",
    "    documentation](https://gtsam.org/doxygen/4.0.0/a02687.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Q: Since GTSAM is available in C++/Python/MATLAB, which language\n",
    "    should I use for other GTSAM projects?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    A: Generating plots is easier in Python/MATLAB, while\n",
    "    C++ has better documentation of GTSAM. Mixing these is also\n",
    "    acceptable, you can save your optimization result from C++ and write\n",
    "    a script to visualize it in Python/MATLAB. Also, check this nice\n",
    "    library for plotting in C++\n",
    "    <https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp>.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In practice, when the computational time matters in the application,\n",
    "    which is mostly true for robotics projects if we want to deploy the\n",
    "    algorithms on the robot eventually, C++ is preferred among the three\n",
    "    languages. Writing GTSAM in C++ is a more common practice for real\n",
    "    applications."
